# Advanced Laboratory: ParticlePhysics
Advanced Laboratory course for Particle Physics taken during the second semester of IMAPP in TU Dortmund University.

## Characterisation of Silicon Strip Sensors
This lab course is a complete study of silicon strip sensors used in the innermost layer of the ATLAS detector.

## Analysis of ATLAS data
This lab course is a full high energy physics data analysis using ATLAS data, focused on the search for new heavy particles predicted by theories beyond the standard model when looking for heavy resonances decaying into two top quarks.
